   <p class="text-p">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by
      nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this internal energy is emited from the Sun's surface as light,
      ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth.

      The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 Miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about
      330,000
      times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[18] Roughly three-quarters of
      the
      Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier
      elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.[19]

      The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually
      white. It
      formed approximately 4.6 billion[a][14][20] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of
      a
      large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting
      disk that
      became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in
      its
      core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.

      Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in the process converts 4
      million
      tons of matter into energy. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is
      the
      source of the Sun's light and heat. Far in the future, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the
      point
      where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and
      temperature which will push its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This
      process
      will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present.
      After
      this, the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no
      longer
      produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.</p>


   <p class="text-p">The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun was thought of by
      some
      cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of some solar
      calendars.
      The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based upon the standard 16th-century
      interpretation of the Sun's observed movement as actual movement.[21</p>


   <h2 class="main-txt" id="second">Etymology</h2>


   <p class="text-p">The English word sun developed from Old English sunne. Cognates appear in other Germanic languages, including West
      Frisian sinne, Dutch zon, Low German Sünn, Standard German Sonne, Bavarian Sunna, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic
      sunnō. All
      these words stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.[22][23] This is ultimately related to the word for sun in other
      branches
      of the Indo-European language family, though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found, rather than the
      genitive stem in n, as for example in Latin sōl, ancient Greek ἥλιος (hēlios), Welsh haul and Czech slunce, as
      well as
      (with *l > r) Sanskrit स्वर (svár) and Persian خور (xvar). Indeed, the l-stem survived in Proto-Germanic as well,
      as
      *sōwelan, which gave rise to Gothic sauil (alongside sunnō) and Old Norse prosaic sól (alongside poetic sunna),
      and
      through it the words for sun in the modern Scandinavian languages: Swedish and Danish sol, Icelandic sól, etc.[23]
   </p>


   <p class="text-p">The principal adjectives for the Sun in English are sunny for sunlight and, in technical contexts, solar
      (/ˈsoʊlər/),[3]
      from Latin sol[24] – the latter found in terms such as solar day, solar eclipse and Solar System (occasionally Sol
      system). From the Greek helios comes the rare adjective heliac (/ˈhiːliæk/).[25] In English, the Greek and Latin
      words
      occur in poetry as personifications of the Sun, Helios (/ˈhiːliəs/) and Sol (/ˈsɒl/),[2][1] while in science
      fiction Sol
      may be used as a name for the Sun to distinguish it from other stars. The term sol with a lower-case s is used by
      planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as Mars.[26]</p>


   <p class="text-p">The English weekday name Sunday stems from Old English Sunnandæg "sun's day", a Germanic interpretation of the
      Latin
      phrase diēs sōlis, itself a translation of the ancient Greek ἡμέρα ἡλίου (hēmera hēliou) 'day of the sun'.[27] The
      astronomical symbol for the Sun is a circle with a center dot, ☉. It is used for such units as M☉ (Solar mass), R☉
      (Solar radius) and L☉ (Solar luminosity).</p>
   <h2 class="main-txt" id="third">General characteristics</h2>


   <p class="text-p">The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that constitutes about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System. The Sun has
      an
      absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which
      are
      red dwarfs.[28][29] The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich,[b] star.[30] The formation of the Sun may
      have
      been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae.[31] This is suggested by a high abundance of
      heavy
      elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called
      Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by
      endothermic
      nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive
      second-generation
      star.</p>


   <p class="text-p">The Sun is by far the brightest object in the Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude of −26.74.[32][33] Thi</p>


   <p class="text-p">One astronomical unit (about 150,000,000 km; 93,000,000 mi) is defined as the mean distance of the Sun's center to
      Earth's center, though the distance varies (by about +/- 2.5 million km or 1.55 million miles) as Earth moves from
      perihelion on about 03 January to aphelion on about 04 July.[34] The distances can vary between 147,098,074 km
      (perihelion) and 152,097,701 km (aphelion), and extreme values can range from 147,083,346 km to 152,112,126
      km.[35] At
      its average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 20
      seconds,[36]
      while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight
      supports almost all life[c] on Earth by photosynthesis,[37] and drives Earth's climate and weather.</p>
